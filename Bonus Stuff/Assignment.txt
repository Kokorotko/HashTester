Theoretically work out the problem of hashing. Using at least two hashing algorithms, create an application to demonstrate the hashing process. The input will be a manually entered text string and a file. Program the hashing functions themselves, with the option to choose the security level and the length of the output value.  Design a way to test the hashing function and a way to demonstrate the change in output value on the change in input value and program these functionalities. Implement the application in a VS environment, C# language, sharing and storing via GitHub.
