//Comment, this program supports formats <STRING> <HEX> <BIN> and works on lines. First is format then two lines will be read and compared. For an example try to generate a Collision in HashingCollisionForm.
//!The program will only check the first format and texts!
//<STRING> Supports UTF-8 format (example al85WTh)
//<HEX> Supports 8D-B7 or 8DB7 doesnt matter if lowercase or uppercase
//<BIN> Supports 0111 0001 with or without spaces between
//There must always be an algorithm and it must be before the format (supported formats: MD5;SHA1;SHA256;SHA512;RIPEMD160;CRC32) example Algorithm=RIPEMD160
//In <HASH> you can find both hashes for text 1 and 2. This is just for user and can be changed freely (why would you do that tho).
